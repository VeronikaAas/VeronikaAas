🎮 Leveling Up:

I'm currently on a quest to master Front-End Development. Just like in gaming, every project is a new level to conquer, and I'm gaining XP with each one. Big projects are my boss battles, and I'm learning so much defeating them.

🧁 Fun Facts

<ul>
  <li>I love baking, and cupcakes are my favourite (power-ups in disguise)</li>
  <li>Dogs are the best companions (like trusty sidekicks)</li>
  <li>Strength training is my side-quest</li>
</ul>

📚 Current Mission:

I'm diving deeper into JavaScript and React, aiming to add more tools to my inventory. The journey is long, but every step is a step closer to becoming a Front-End Hero!
